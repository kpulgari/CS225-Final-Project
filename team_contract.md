# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
We are planning to meet once per week on Friday at 4 pm. Each meeting will last an hour or two. We are going to use Discord to if we need to communicate online. We will only take notes if we need to. 
2. **Assistance** 
We are going to use Discord to contact each other online. We expect each other to respond within an hour.
3. **Respect** 
We are going to ensure that each of us has an opportunity to speak by making sure that we respect each others' comments. Everyone who wants to speak will get the opportunity to do so.
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We will write tasks for each person and if someone has trouble finishing a task we will help each other out. We will delegate tasks depending on our strengths.
5. **Time Commitment** 
We will plan 3-4 per week for per person and if someone falls behind we will allocate the time efficiency. We will send messaging to each other if we are falling behind.
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
We hope to solve any conflicts in our weekly in-person meeting. If someone is not doing their task, we are going to address the situation in the meeting.
